# Sorting-Algorithms

- This is a college project made with the goal to compare two differents sorting algorithms, called Bubblesort and Quicksort
- Including some libraries as <sys/time.h>, it was possible to measure theirs excution time and print it on the terminal 
- Therefore, we can see which one actually is the most effective sorting algorithm to be used
